<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Each person needs a different amount of time to complete a task. This time changes based on their abilities and how they interact with content.</p>
<p>It is important to warn people about any timeouts in an application. Warnings should be displayed clearly at the beginning of a task. A second notification should occur immediately prior to the timeout. Knowing the time allotted for a task allows people to organize and complete it successfully.</p>
