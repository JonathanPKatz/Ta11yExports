<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Some online services have enabled a security system to protect a person’s data. These systems are essential when information is sensitive. One way that these systems protect data is to log a person out automatically when:</p>
<ul>
<li>the session has been inactive for some time;</li>
<li>the person logs in to the same account from another device;</li>
<li>other suspicious activity occurs.</li>
</ul>
<p>In all these cases, the most important accessibility outcome is to retain the person’s data. When the person logs in again, all data entered before the timeout must still be there.</p>
