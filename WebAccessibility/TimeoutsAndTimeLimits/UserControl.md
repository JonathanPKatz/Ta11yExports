<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>One of the most complex tasks on websites is completing forms. However, this task can become even more challenging when the form has a time constraint. Timed activities can vary in complexity. People with visual, motor, and cognitive disabilities may need more time to read and complete more complex tasks online.</p>
<p>To make any timed activity accessible, ensure that the time limit can be either:</p>
<ul>
<li>disabled,</li>
<li>adjusted,</li>
<li>or extended.</li>
</ul>
