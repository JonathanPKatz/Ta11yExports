<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>All people have different speeds of response to an action. Their response time depends on many factors, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>their speed of movement,</li>
<li>ability to focus and remember,</li>
<li>the use of assistive technologies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some applications have time limits for specific tasks, such as taking tests. Others may time out for security reasons, such as protecting your personal data. You must inform people in advance about any time-based limitations. Knowing when an application will timeout is essential so people don’t lose data unexpectedly. By telling people the time allotted to complete a task, they can prepare and manage their time in an effective way.</p>
<p>Letting people adjust or extend a time limit is best. When people can control timeouts, they can take the time needed to complete tasks successfully. The best option is to avoid timeouts. You should only use timeouts or time limits if they are truly needed.</p>
