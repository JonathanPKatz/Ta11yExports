<p>Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility have a shared goal: to help users. SEO helps search engines find the content that best suits our query. Accessibility makes this content accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities. The practices that improve SEO also help assistive technologies better understand the content. Plus, they help people find what they’re looking for, whether using a search engine or a screen reader. For this, make sure that alternative text, titles, headings, and link text makes sense. By making the content understandable for everyone, we make it understandable for SEO.</p>
