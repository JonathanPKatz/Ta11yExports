<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>It is important for people to understand a website’s context and purpose. This is especially true for people with cognitive or learning disabilities.</p>
<p>These individuals are helped by:</p>
<ul>
<li>A clear title, short description, and main heading that explains the purpose of a page</li>
<li>Descriptive headings and labeled sections that make the site easier to understand and navigate.</li>
</ul>
<p>These methods provide context and organize the site. Focusing on a clear purpose improves the user experience for people with disabilities. Ultimately, it improves the user experience for everyone.</p>
