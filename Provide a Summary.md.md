<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In this information age, it often feels like there is too much to read. A good summary gives a reader enough information to quickly determine whether a web page or document meets their needs.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>If you have ever used the acronyms BLUF (bottom line up front) or TL;DR (too long; didn’t read), you already understand why a summary is important. A good summary helps readers quickly determine whether a web page or document has the content they want.</p>
<ul>
<li>The longer a document, the more critical the summary.</li>
<li>The more complex a document, the greater the need for a simple overview.</li>
</ul>
<p>A summary can save everyone time but especially benefits people with cognitive and learning disabilities.</p>
<h2 id="who-is-helped">Who is Helped</h2>
<p>People with disabilities affecting language, processing, or memory benefit from clear, easy-to-understand summaries. The summary highlights the purpose and content of the web page or document and helps these individuals decide if the content contains the information they need.</p>
<h2 id="guidelines">Guidelines</h2>
