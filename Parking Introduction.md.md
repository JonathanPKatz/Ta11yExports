<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>When organizations provide parking, they must also provide accessible parking spaces. How many and what types of accessible parking depend on the size and type of parking lot the organization provides. Accessible parking spaces include features that make it easier for people with disabilities to get out of their vehicles and get to the facility or service available from the parking space. Accessible parking spaces must be marked so they are easy to find and individuals without disabilities can avoid parking in them.</p>
