<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>It is essential for all of us to write and speak respectfully about disability. Use the word “disability” instead of phrases like “differently-abled” or “special abilities.” Use the person-first or identify-first language preferred by the community and individual being described. Most importantly, avoid bias in yourself and in the language that you use.</p>
