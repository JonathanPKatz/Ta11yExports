<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>
<p><strong>Access aisle:</strong> An area next to an accessible parking space set aside for the person using that parking space. Drivers and passengers use these aisles to enter and exit a vehicle, deploy wheelchair lifts, or transfer from a vehicle to a mobility device. <em>ADA</em></p>
<p><strong>Accessible:</strong> describes a place, object, service, or content that a person with a disability can perceive, use, interact with, or understand. In some countries, “accessible” describes places, objects, services, or content that meet legal standards for accessibility to people with disabilities. <em>ACA ADA EAA Mex UK</em></p>
<p><strong>Accessible means of egress:</strong> A continuous and accessible route from any point in a building facility to an exit, refuge area, or public right of way. The routes lead to <strong>emergency egress</strong> points**.** <em>ADA</em></p>
<p><strong>Accessible path of travel:</strong> see <strong>accessible route</strong></p>
<p><strong>Accessible restroom</strong>: see <strong>accessible toilet room</strong> <em>ADA</em></p>
<p><strong>Accessible route:</strong> a route that provides a consistent connection between different accessible elements. The route must be continuous and uninterrupted, without any objects or obstructions that would interrupt it. There are three types of accessible paths of travel:</p>
<p>-              <strong>Accessible routes from site arrival points:</strong> Connect facility entrances and sidewalks, parking, drop-off areas, or transit stops. These are also called accessible paths of travel.<br>
-              <strong>Exterior accessible routes within a site:</strong> Connect different facilities or buildings to one another<br>
-              <strong>Interior accessible routes:</strong> Connect different points of interest within a facility or building to one another.</p>
<p>In some countries, all accessible routes are called accessible paths of travel. These routes can include circulation paths. <em>ACA ADA MEX</em></p>
<p><strong>Accessible toilet room:</strong> Any room with a toilet that meets accessibility standards. These are usually restrooms, but can be part of a restroom facility - for example, if the toilets and sinks are in separate rooms. In many countries, the terms <strong>accessible restroom</strong> or <strong>accessible</strong> <strong>washroom</strong> are more common. <em>ACA ADA</em></p>
<p><strong>Accessible washroom</strong>: see <strong>accessible toilet room.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alert and signal devices:</strong> tools that indicate an emergency or other important event to people present in a building. Common examples include fire alarms, smoke detectors, entrance bells, and door closing warning devices. <em>ACA</em></p>
<p>Many regulations specify the need for <strong>audible signals</strong> that someone can hear and <strong>visual signals</strong> that someone can see. Audible signals must meet certain sound and frequency requirements. Visual signals must meet certain brightness and frequency requirements. <em>ADA ACA</em></p>
<p><strong>Alteration:</strong> a temporary or permanent physical change to a building or facility that could affect whether the building is accessible. Common alterations include construction detours, renovations, equipment replacement, refinished floor surfaces, and revised signage. In some cases, alterations can pose obstacles, create protrusions, or lead to a change in level. <em>ACA ADA</em></p>
<p><strong>Approach:</strong> a route leading to the entrance of a site, building, facility, or element, or a specific fixture or element. An accessible approach meets standards for accessible routes. Approaches to facilities and elements must meet certain standards to be accessible.</p>

<p><strong>Assembly area:</strong> A part of or an entire building or facility used for gatherings. These areas may be for entertainment, government, educational, or business purposes. Examples include classrooms, courtrooms, theaters, auditoriums, and arenas. Laws in most countries mandate that these areas must be accessible. <em>ADA</em></p>
<p><strong>Assistive listening device:</strong> A portable system used to amplify or distinguish sounds. Many people use these devices to provide additional support beyond a hearing aid or cochlear implant. They are often used together with <strong>assistive listening systems.</strong> <em>MN</em></p>
<p><strong>Assistive listening system:</strong> A system installed in a building or facility that provides amplified audio for people who use hearing aids or other assistive technology. The system connects with the device a person uses to provide amplified, clear sound. The system is connected with a microphone. Systems are named for their technology. The most common system is an audio induction loop; FM radio devices, Bluetooth devices, and infrared headset systems are also in use. <em>ACA ADA MN UK</em></p>

Clearances help people with disabilities approach, use, and leave these features. Clearances also help people who use wheelchairs and other mobility devices turn or maneuver in a space. In some countries, regulations distinguish <strong>clear floor space, clear ground space,</strong> and <strong>turning space,</strong> as well as <strong>transfer spaces.</strong> <em>ACA ADA</em></li>
<li>Space under, above, or around an element that protects people from bumping into surfaces, especially if those surfaces can harm them.

<p><strong>Skid resistance:</strong> see <strong>slip resistance</strong></p>
<p><strong>Slip resistance:</strong> Describes a floor surface that reduces the risk of people and their mobility aids from losing grip on the floor and falling. These surfaces are made of materials that provide friction to the foot or mobility aid. Slip-resistant surfaces are also configured to prevent slipping, for example, through texturing. Hazards, such as spills of water and oil or <strong>protrusions</strong>, can affect slip resistance. Different levels of slip resistance are required in different contexts. The slip-resistant surface must also be <strong>stable</strong>. Some countries use the term “skid resistant.” <em>ACA ADA</em></p>
<p><strong>Slope:</strong> The incline of a surface such as a ramp, curb ramp, walkway, or corridor. You can measure slope by using a ratio, such as 1:12. The ratio measures the amount of vertical rise over a length of horizontal distance. For example, a rise of 1 centimetre over 12 centimeters of length would produce a ratio of 1:12.</p>
<p>There are two types of slope:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cross slope:</strong> A change in slope that is perpendicular to the direction of travel. This change is called perpendicular slope in some countries.</li>
<li><strong>Running slope</strong>: parallel to the direction of travel.</li>
</ul>
<p>In some countries, the term <strong>pitch</strong> is used for the slope of ramps and stairwells. Stair pitch is the angle, or slope, at which stair steps ascend or descend. Slope is often measured alongside <strong>rise.</strong></p>

This type of surface is necessary for people to navigate safely without falling or with the aid of a mobility device. These surfaces are generally hard and continuous, such as wood, concrete, or vinyl planking. In some countries, these are also called <strong>stable surfaces.</strong> Such surfaces must also be <strong>slip resistant.</strong> <em>ADA</em></p>
<p><strong>Stair lift:</strong> see <strong>platform lift.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stair nosing:</strong> The extended front edge of a step on a staircase. These both protect the staircase and help blind people detect the edge. <em>ACA</em></p>
