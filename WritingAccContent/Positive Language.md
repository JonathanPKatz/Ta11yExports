<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Negative statements and double negatives can be confusing. Use positive statements instead of negative ones to clarify the sentence’s intent. Avoid double negatives to simplify the meaning of a sentence.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In standard English, using positive language simplifies sentence structure and clarifies content. Negative statements and double negatives are confusing for most people. Using negative language can prevent the completion of tasks if the content needs to be clearly understood.</p>
<p>Double negatives cancel each other out, resulting in a positive sentence. Double negatives create a cognitive load for readers as they must process the sentence to convert what sounds negative to a positive statement. Use a positive statement instead of a negative one to make the intent of the sentence clear.</p>
<h2 id="who-is-helped">Who is Helped</h2>
<p>People with cognitive and learning disabilities that impact language skills, such as dyslexia and limited memory, can find double negatives or negative statements confusing.</p>
<p>Using double negatives or negative statements also impacts people with low reading literacy and people who speak another native language.</p>
<p>In standard English, many people find double negatives and negative statements confusing. We all benefit from using clear, understandable language.</p>
<h2 id="guidelines">Guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li>Write positive statements when possible.</li>
<li>Do not combine two or more negative words to create a positive statement.</li>
<li>Avoid negative statements that include words such as not, cannot, do not, and words starting with “un.” If you find statements like these, consider whether they can be simplified and written from a positive instead of a negative point of view.</li>
<li>These guidelines may differ in other languages and in different dialects of English. You may need to use a negative statement if this is what your audience will understand.</li>
</ul>
