<p>Semantic markup is a way of writing code to reflect the meaning of the content. Assistive technologies rely on semantic markup to understand content. This reliance means it is critical for code to have semantically correct markup.</p>
<p>For example: a heading is semantically correct if it is coded as a heading. If a heading is coded as a paragraph with large text, then its appearance is different from its meaning. Devices like screen readers will not understand this is a heading.</p>
