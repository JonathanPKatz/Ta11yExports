<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The primary goal of writing accessible content is to help people find the things they need and understand how to use the things they find. Writing content that is clear, consistent, simple, straightforward, organized, and well-structured can help everyone to more easily perceive and better understand what they read.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>It is important for all readers to easily perceive and understand written content. Clear, consistent, and logically organized content can significantly improve accessibility. The best way to do this is to keep content as simple and straightforward as possible. This does not mean you need to “dumb down” content. It means you should avoid being overly complex when it is not necessary.</p>
<p>Writing accessible content is really about writing usable, understandable content. It ensures people can easily find the information they are looking for and understand how to use information when they find it. The guidelines for writing accessible content describe how to create content that everyone can understand and use.</p>
<p>Watch this short <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/understandable/">Understandable Content video</a> from the Web Accessibility Initiative to see how writing accessible content supports people with disabilities while providing a better experience for everyone.</p>
<h2 id="who-is-helped">Who is Helped</h2>
<p>Certain cognitive disabilities can impact language skills. This includes people with reading difficulties, processing difficulties, limited memory, and limited focus who benefit from accessible content. Individuals who rely on assistive technology also benefit from clear, concise, and well-structured content that is accessible. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A person with dyslexia may find it easier to understand common or familiar words and phrases that they already know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Someone with limited language skills may also have a limited vocabulary and may not understand uncommon words or metaphorical phrases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Someone who is neurodivergent may have difficulty understanding metaphors and similes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An individual with limited memory or focus will benefit from shorter phrases, sentences, and paragraphs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A clear content structure will help someone who is easily distracted or has difficulties remembering information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An individual who is blind will rely on well-structured headings, lists, and tables to understand the content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Someone with low reading literacy or who natively speaks another language will also benefit from accessible content.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Having a clear content structure makes it easier to find specific content. Concise, descriptive content makes it easier to understand information. Clear, understandable language reduces cognitive load for everyone. Ultimately, we all benefit when content is accessible.</p>
