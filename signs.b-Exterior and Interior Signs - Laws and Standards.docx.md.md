<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Signs play an important part in the lives of people with disabilities. Many places can become difficult, even dangerous, without proper signs. Accessible features, like bathrooms or routes, must be clearly marked with accessible signs. Without these signs, people with disabilities could have trouble finding their way. They may be unable to use the available services, or unwilling to put themselves at risk. Ultimately, they may choose to go elsewhere.</p>
<h2 id="laws-and-standards-by-country">Laws and Standards by Country</h2>
<p>Accessibility laws and standards may vary by country, and sometimes by region.</p>
<p>Besides restricting who can use their services, organizations may face penalties, like fines or court cases, if their locations are not up to the laws of the local government. Standards can be required by law, or highly recommended by organizations that support people with disabilities.</p>
<p>Laws also change regularly. There are many currently being written, updated, or litigated, all over the world. This is not intended to be a complete list and is expected to change over time.</p>
<p>Please contact us if the country you are looking for is not listed.</p>
<h3 id="united-states-u.s.-standards">United States (U.S.) Standards</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ada.gov/law-and-regs/ada/">Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, As Amended</a>, or simply the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), provides legal protections for people with disabilities.</p>
<p>The ADA is a civil rights law that prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in many areas of public life, including jobs, schools, transportation, and many public and private places that are open to the general public. The purpose of the law is to make sure that people with disabilities have the same rights and opportunities as everyone else. (<a href="https://adata.org/factsheet/ADA-overview">An overview of the ADA, ADA National Network</a>)</p>
<p>Under the ADA, the <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ada/">U.S. Access Board</a> provides standards, training, and technical information to remove any barrier that stops a person with a disability from participating fully in U.S. society.</p>
<p>To make sure that a location meets the ADA standards for accessible signs, there are two primary things to check: (1) whether the signs provided follow the applicable ADA Standards; and (2) whether the organization has provided the correct signs.</p>
<p>For accessible signage, ADA Standards cover the construction of signs, text, Braille, and pictograms on signs, and the purpose, location, and quantity of signs.</p>
<p><strong>Exceptions:</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ada/#ada-216">ADA Accessibility Standards for Signs</a> do not apply to all signs. For example, temporary signs, company names or logos, building directories, and menus do not have to be accessible.</p>
<p>Parking also has specific requirements; see <strong>Parking (Ta11y)</strong> for more info.</p>
